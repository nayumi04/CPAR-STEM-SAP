<h4> Angeles </h4>
<p>People have been and always be different from each other, being one's own unique person is the only constant in any culture or society. Therefore, diverse backgrounds among people is nothing to be feared of, especially when it has existed in this world for so long. The perseverance of individuality is a uniting factor in itself, people want to experience difference, they want to engage their senses in something they don't have; this instinct is a value that has fostered art and culture, people explore their resources and horizons across diverse backgrounds to hone their own. Pieces of culture are carried by people wherever they go as part of their personality, these form an individual person, identical to no one; there is no existing bias in discovering and building yourself, making culture the ultimate bind for society.  

 

Expression of connection is best seen in the arts, when one's taste is akin to others, they often converse on it, once again exploring the bounds of diversity. They build on the topic, this enriches the art community, as well as the relationships in society. Since art is one of the broadest areas of study, it bodes well with diversity, as both stimulate the distinctive characteristics of people; art, in turn, would now function as an extension of a person, allowing people greater freedom to converse and connect with one another.

<h4> Barrozo </h4>
<p> 
     A constant in our realm of reality is the very notion that art is the person behind it. The very mediums and forms that we give heed to and learn more about through our own lifetime are products of the complex human mind. A world of emotion and an ocean of thoughts. Art, in its very essence, is human. That is a fact undeniable to all of us, for we ourselves are true and defining examples of art.  

 

Therefore, art is deeply rooted in the constructs that have come to arise from human conception. Society and culture, and in turn, the world at large, owes a great deal to art. The very fact that art is human yields its connective power. The humanity, the story, meaning and creation behind a certain piece of work, of the art is what draws the humanity of others to it. We connect to art because we recognize that it is speaking to us. It is communicating with a part of ourselves. We forge connections with the art itself, and in turn, we recognize the beauty of the humane soul who brought it all forth.  

 

Just as every individual is different, art is also different. It comes in various ways, made in differing manners, and reaches varying audiences. Therefore, the incorporation of the very idea of diversity in human individuality applies to the individual spark and nature of art. Through differences, art unites the masses, because being different is being human.

<h4> De Jesus </h4>
<p>
“A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and soul of its people” - Mahatma Gandhi. 

This quote summarizes the question as culture brings people together, as it is our shared identity.  These artworks serve as a bridge for us to connect to the past and have a glimpse of the lives of our ancient ancestors as well as give us a sense of belonging and purpose. Art, a short word as it may seem, holds a lot of significance especially in our country which is an archipelago. The artworks from the different parts of the country make me appreciate the diversity and creativity that is innate in all of us regardless of where we are from in the Philippines. We are brought together by our wit and knowledge in different forms of art that are worth being proud of.

<h4> Ecobiza </h4>
<p>The role of culture and arts plays an important part in fostering deeper connections amongst different individuals from diverse backgrounds. Throughout the years, there are various art mediums out there that have been used as a form of expression and to help promote cultures from different places around the country or can be from other countries as well. Wherein it's a way of having an open conversation excluding the fact of having communication itself. Since making art gives a sense of connection with the artist and the observer. In which the observer tries to understand or grasp what the artist wants to convey or what kind of message that the audience needs to decipher.   

 

Having exposure to different forms of art helps individuals appreciate diversity and form meaningful connections, by creating space for different cultures to be learned, be known, understanding unique perspectives, and acknowledging other experiences. This serves as a bridge between two entities of reality. Which serves as a barrier between the artists and the audience itself. With the use of different forms of art in trying to express themselves through mediums that they are used at.  

 

In today’s society it’s important to acknowledge and learn about different art forms that can be used as a medium of expression. Since in making art, there can be a sense of connection and an in depth understanding of the reason behind a specific artwork that the artist wants to convey. Wherein every medium of art is like a message hidden in a beautiful masterpiece. With this it takes a person to have patience and interest in transcribing what the message could be.
