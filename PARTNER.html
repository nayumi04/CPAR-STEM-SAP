The STEM 1 students eagerly participated in the Social Action Program, a new and exciting experience for many, particularly in mentoring high school students from Recto High School, whom they affectionately referred to as their anak for the day. Despite initial nervousness, they remained optimistic and embraced the opportunity. Each pair had unique interactions, as some students were shy and nervous, while others were energetic and outgoing, creating a dynamic experience. Gabrillo and Cortez, for instance, worked with their anak whose energy level differed from theirs, yet this contrast enriched their communication. Similarly, Kamatoy and Ingel’s anak, Abcdef, was initially shy, but with the help of Xy, the anak of Kuichi, Deo, and Paolo, they were able to create a more comfortable and engaging environment and ended up co-parenting which leveled up the experience for the five of them. Many students were really interested in the museum visit, eagerly taking photos of paintings, and admiring the artworks with curiosity and wonder. As one STEM 1 student noted, “Seeing their joy in exploring the museum made the whole experience worthwhile.” Although not everyone interacted with all the students, it was collectively observed that they were well-mannered, polite, and respectful, making the entire event a fulfilling and successful experience. 
The Social Action Program of San Beda University Manila for Senior High School students is a transformative initiative that fosters social responsibility, leadership, and community engagement. Rooted in the Benedictine values of ora et labora (prayer and work), this program encourages students to become compassionate and proactive agents of change in society. Through various outreach activities, environmental initiatives, and community development projects, students gain firsthand experience in addressing social issues such as poverty, education, and sustainability. The program includes immersion experiences, volunteer work, and partnerships with marginalized communities, allowing students to apply their knowledge and skills for the common good.

 National Museum of Fine Arts gives a sense of organized disorder. Corridors and hallways stretch far and wide with rooms labeled for each artist. Such architectural flow presents freedom for the audience to explore any room. This is where the order diminishes and disarray is introduced. Each wall is plastered with various artworks, filling the blank walls with color and life. This contrasts the rudimentary atmosphere of The National Museum prior to its renovation when it was once a National Library. This outreach activity allowed me to further examine the creativity and resourcefulness of Filipinos, transforming something beyond its purpose into something more visionary.


     When it came to accompanying the 8th Grade student from Recto High School, it was an overall immersive experience. We both were intrigued by the varying pieces of artworks from different artists. Our most memorable experience would be the Fernando Amorsolo segment. I had the opportunity to explain his pieces and what made him stand out from other artists. The vibrance and greenery of all his pieces lit up the room keeping us consumed in the room for minutes. 

      To conclude, this social activity program has allowed me to educate my accompanied student and my curiosity regarding the value of Philippine arts and Architectural creativity of The National Museum of Fine Arts. I look forward to more experiences like this to immerse myself with culture rich places in our country and presenting my learnings to different kinds of people.

The students from 12 STEM 3 focused on simply having fun. We let out our "inner childs" as we ventured throughout the museum with our Grade 8 buddies. We took the time to bond with them and get to know them more than just teaching them the values of art. In a way, this also made us reminisce about the times when we visited places like these at a younger age. Getting to know our grade 8 buddies, their lifestyles, was a very touching experience. Although we found out some of them come from difficult backgrounds and we deciphered that their educational curriculum is a bit different, that did not change our perspectives as we saw them have plenty of fun with their classmates too. Overall, they were very humble and sweet, and this gave us a sense of realization as ates and kuyas. This outreach did not only teach us about art, but it taught us more about meeting children from places we aren't familiar with. Programs like these further encourage us students to develop our humble hearts of volunteerism and selfless acts, as we embody the benedictine hallmark of love of christ and neighbour.

Culture and the arts play an important role in building connections among people from different backgrounds by allowing people to express themselves through various forms, such as music, unique dances, literature, and of course visual arts. As said by almost everyone in our reflection, culture, history, and arts help us better understand life and history. These expressions serve as bridges/way that connect people and help them share their different experiences and ideas with others, regardless of differences in language, ethnicity, or cultural traditions of people. Many of the class’s reflections also emphasized how art has the power to unite people, offering us a space where we can explore perspectives different from our own, and how there’s unity in knowing that we learned about this art even before entering the Museum, not just in our class but this trait was also observed form our partner school. Just as one classmate said, art creates a sense of belonging and helps individuals feel connected to their history and identity. This shows that whether through the artifacts of our ancestors or the contemporary art we create today, culture remains a reflection of human ingenuity shaping how we understand and appreciate each other on different levels.

Additionally, another key insight shared is that art functions as a universal language, allowing different people to connect even without the use of words or basically verbal communication. Our visit to the National Museum of Anthropology highlighted this idea since as students of San Beda Manila were able to appreciate and relate the art and artifacts of various cultures despite their differences, to notice the essence of art is just as important as learning about the art. One of us reflected on how seeing these works face to face helped them understand the struggles and triumphs of those who came before us, our ancestors making them realize the importance of preserving cultural heritage in order for it to still be learned and teached even after generations. And others noted how exposure to different forms of art can dissolve stereotypes and biases because you start to appreciate and genuinely learn about art more fostering empathy and mutual respect. It was also pointed out that by learning about the history and traditions of different communities, we can gain a deeper appreciation for our shared humanity. Our differences do not divide us but rather, they enrich our understanding of each other and create opportunities for meaningful connections.
